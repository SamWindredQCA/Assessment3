### Related project 1 ###
*Fiber Optic Lighting for Wearable Tech: Beginner How-To Guide*

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nitoFevfIJg


This project is related to my original project idea. Originally I was going to try and create a dress that showed a piece of artwork relating to music. The art-work was going to be animated and show on the skirt of the dress.


### Related project 2 ###
*Interactive Video Projection Dress: Wearable Tech*

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su30-wiF7m4

This was another lighting idea that I had for the dress, but I decided that making this dress would get way too expensive.


### Related project 3 ###
*LED Lights for Wearable Tech: Beginner How-To Guide*

Watching this video gave me an insight on how cool LED's in fabric could look. From this video I came up with my final project idea.

### *Brief resource name/description* ###

*Provide a link, reference, or whatever is required for somebody else to find the resource. Then provide a few comments about what you have drawn from the resource.*

## Conceptual progress ##

### Design intent ###
*Include your design intent here. It should be about a 10 word phrase/sentence.*

### Design concept 1 ###
*Interactive Toy Robot*

<img src="img/ideas.jpg" width="300" height="500">

When interacted with in different ways, it will display different emotions with a sound and visual.

### Design concept 2 ###
*Holo Chess Board*

<img src="img/holo.jpg" width="300" height="500"> <img src="img/holo_2.jpg" width="300" height="500">

Inspiration from the Holo Chess played in the Star Wars films.

### Final design concept ###
*Fiber optic Dress/LED dress*

<img src="img/howto.jpg" width="300" height="500">

For this project I wanted to be able to incorporate fibre optics and RGB LEDs. This would be achieved by serving the electronics into the dress.

### Interaction flowchart ###
*Draw a draft flowchart of what you anticipate the interaction process in your project to be. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Physical experimentation documentation ##

*In this section, show your progress including whichever of the following are appropriate for your project at this point.
a.	Technical development. Could be code screenshots, pictures of electronics and hardware testing, video of tests. 
b.	Fabrication. Physical models, rough prototypes, sketches, diagrams of form, material considerations, mood boards, etc.
Ensure you include comments about the choices you've made along the way.*

*You will probably have a range of images and screenshots. Any test videos should be uploaded to YouTube or other publicly accessible site and a link provided here.*

## Design process discussion ##
For this project I decided to create a dress that displays different colours depending on the amount of light. I had two different ideas for now to illuminate the dress.
- Fibre optics with LED lights
- Wire LED's

The lighting option I chose for this project was the cheapest lighting option that I could come up with and the most effective with the materials that I have.

## Next steps ##
- Complete sewing the dress
- Sew the electronics into the dress
- Film the dress in action
